The Contact Management System developed in C++ by Deep (ID: 23AIML024), Dhairya (ID: 23AIML022), and Yash (ID: 23AIML012) is a comprehensive program designed to facilitate the efficient organization and management of contact information. This dynamic system offers a user-friendly interface for users to perform various operations, including adding, editing, searching, deleting, and sorting contacts.
Key Features:

  1) Contact Class: The project includes a Contact class that encapsulates contact details such as phone number, name, address, and description. Methods within this class facilitate setting and displaying contact information.

  2) ContactManager Class: The ContactManager class manages a collection of contacts, providing functionalities to add, edit, delete, search, display, and sort contacts. Additionally, it includes validation checks for phone numbers to ensure data integrity.

  3) User Interface: The program features a menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with the system seamlessly. Users can choose from various options displayed in the menu to perform desired operations on contacts.

How to Use:

Upon execution, the program presents users with a menu prompting them to select an action to perform on contacts. Users can input their choice by entering a corresponding number. The system then executes the chosen operation, providing feedback and guidance as needed.
